# MyWeddingWebsite
This website will host all the details for my wedding. It will include all the details for the wedding as well as how my guests can RSVP. This websites purpose is to go paperless for my wedding and send out wedding invites electronically and efficiently. 

# Architecture
This website is built on React and hosted on AWS. To enable my guests to rsvp and receive correspondence on my wedding, I created an API to allow my guests to paperless RSVP via my webpage and securely save/store their information in my AWS S3 bucket for future use for wedding invitations.
