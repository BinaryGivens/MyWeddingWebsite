            Hello Wedding Guests,
          </p>
          <p className='gift-body'>
            If you have journeyed to this portion of the website
            we first want to start by thanking you for considering getting
            us a wedding gift. However, we have decided to go a non-traditional route. Instead of a registry, we would greatly appreciate
            any contributions to our honeymoon fund. We would love for you all to be apart of our
            journey. So Below will be the details of our Honeymoon!
